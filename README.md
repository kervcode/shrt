it is actually increasing it. There might be a slight deacrease. However, the produce code during Pair Prog. has a few advantages-

When to Pair
1. Complex Code
2. Volatile Sections
3. Critical Systems
4. Core Lybraries

   
  ① - Have more than one person who understand the complexity of the code. 
Complex code often get the most bugs. Not maintainable. So it is good to have someone to bounce an idea off.
  
  ② Helps with keeping bug factor low. It does not have to do with complex code or something complicated. It has more to do with the team sustainability Let's take as example a repetitive task that will often change. It will be ideal to have some team members pair of such tasks. That way the teams will not be amputated if the person who always work on such task
became unavailable. These prehentives pairings help keep bug factor low, respond quickly and without having to depend on certain people to get things done.Another volatile sections is useful; 
because of frequent change. they are more prone to buy than any other spot. 
Every time we change something, we have the opportunity to introduce new bug. 
Volatile section are really a great way to pread knowledge across a team and also assure the changes that are being made are in great order, be able to add as much as you can to them without making significant changes because you have to change them a lot. (Wath when to pait section again if

Benefits of Pairing - Fewer defects in the codes. 
Reasons: there is always two sets 
of eyes-looking at the code.
Knowledge Transfer 
There is always one person transfering knowledge the other. That is from the navigator to the driver and vis-versa , 
knowledge transfer is sharing experience 
the person who is familiar with the system the most is able to share that knowledge to others. in the teams. 
This avoid information to be siloed

not a few.from one person or j
Bus factor 
Transfering knowledge around the team increase what is called busfactor. what is a Bus factor? A Bus' Factor is a measurement of a many people on a team would need to be hit by a bus before the team is in trouble.

Increase Productivity 
there is slight decrease. However, 
-the code produce during Pairing is always have higher quality fewer bugs.

How do the get the information that one was better than the other'
Blind analysis.
has some juges review the code. and decide which code was better, working correctly, and produce the correct result. the juge did not know which code 
was from the pair or from' lone dex. s. the pair gets the higher rating. with Fewer bugs and better maintainable code.. 
In the long, we get increased productivity.
IT mprove morale many orgs focus is to develop trust and get the 
team to communicate
with each other,Improve morale is not a problem on teams that doing pairing because they are having to work together consistently every day. The rely on each other to help them with all the tasks the are doing. Communicating & collaborating make folks in a team get used to their team, get along with their team, build trust and more.
Trust increases velocity all these aspect improve the morale of the team. At the end pairing Benefits the team.
> Constant Review.
One person is able to see the other person decisions, give feedback and ask question while the code isbeing written. Able to answer to recall what
question on the spot instead of trying you wrote days later,
Also able to redirect, correct mystate on the spot. 
save time, reduce technical debt.

suite
Mission Critical, it has to stay up. has to keep running part of an application; its important that we pair for that because what we don't want to do is create a bug-ridden, hard to maintain piece - of functionality that has to run at all times. but every one else is afraid to touch Example: A service that is running in the background that no one remembers how it works,everytime someone does they go and they get confused by the code. happens when someone worked solo on such project on service. and is not around anymore to maintain it. 
I_Two people know how it works to begin with 2- More pairing equal more people that know how it works. 3- Less Kikely to have bugs when you have two people 4- . Having more than me people working on codes/ 
project/ Critical systems, they tend to move towards an easier-to-read design because if either to do something complicated, the other and propose something simpler.

## AWS 

Here's a structured goal tailored to your AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam preparation:

**Goal:** Achieve AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate certification by December 2024, completing the coursework and meeting proficiency standards across all major AWS domains.

**Measure:**

1. **Complete the Udemy course**: Progress through all course modules, using hands-on labs and practice tests to solidify concepts. Ensure completion by mid-December 2024, with practice test scores reaching at least 85% proficiency across all areas.

2. **Weekly Study Plan**: Dedicate a minimum of 2 hours per day as planned, with progress checks every two weeks to ensure adherence and retention of core AWS concepts.

3. **Mock Exam Milestone**: Take two full mock exams in the last two weeks before the exam date, aiming for a score of 90% or higher, indicating readiness.

4. **Peer Review and Feedback**: Partner with a study group or mentor by early December 2024 to review key topics and identify any remaining areas for improvement. Adjust study priorities based on feedback.

5. **Certification Completion**: Sit for the exam in December 2024, with certification obtained by the end of the month, ready to apply AWS architectural best practices to SaaS and other business projects.

This structure aligns with your goal of proficiency and certification within a specific timeframe, while supporting continued AWS learning and skills application.
