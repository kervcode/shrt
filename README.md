## AWS Fundamentals

completed the AWS Fundamentals section, gaining a solid understanding of AWS’s global infrastructure, including regions, availability zones, and edge locations. You explored the AWS Management Console and learned about key services like EC2, S3, and CloudFront, focusing on the core services needed for certification. Additionally, you have been introduced to the Well-Architected Framework, covering its six pillars—operational excellence, performance efficiency, security, cost optimization, reliability, and sustainability. This foundational knowledge sets you on a strong path for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect exam.

## IAM

You gained a solid understanding of IAM, which is essential for managing users, groups, roles, and their access levels within AWS. You learned about securing the root account, primarily through enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) to protect against unauthorized access. Additionally, you explored IAM's global nature, meaning that it operates across all AWS regions. You also covered IAM policies, which are written in JSON format, to control permissions for users and groups, as well as best practices such as following the principle of least privilege and organizing permissions via groups instead of individual users. Furthermore, you learned about programmatic access using access keys, and you touched on Identity Federation, allowing integration with external identity providers like Active Directory.

## S3

Learned the fundamentals of S3, one of AWS’s most important services, focusing on its structure, scalability, and simplicity as an object-based storage system. Key concepts include buckets, where files are stored, the key-value system for naming objects, and how S3 ensures availability and durability across multiple locations. You also covered security using encryption, access control lists (ACLs), and bucket policies. Additionally, you explored S3’s strong consistency model and common use cases, including lifecycle management, versioning, and optimizing S3 performance through prefixes and multipart uploads.

## EC2

covered the essentials of Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), a key service in AWS that provides secure, resizable virtual servers in the cloud. EC2 allows developers to run applications with flexibility and scalability, offering different pricing models: On-Demand, Reserved, Spot Instances, and Dedicated Hosts. These options cater to various workloads, from short-term testing to long-term predictable use cases. EC2 is fundamental to cloud infrastructure, offering cost-efficiency, rapid deployment, and full control over virtual machines.

# Python

## 1

Provides a comprehensive introduction to Python programming by covering key concepts such as data types, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and file handling. It includes practical demos such as building a tax calculator, a rock-paper-scissors game, and working with APIs, helping learners apply theoretical concepts through hands-on examples. Topics like dictionaries, JSON handling, pip for package management, and exception handling are also explored, offering a well-rounded foundation for Python development. The course ensures a solid grasp of Python, preparing learners for more advanced applications.

# 2 

Delves into the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm in Python. It explores foundational OOP concepts like designing classes, instantiating objects, and managing attributes, along with more advanced topics such as encapsulation, class inheritance, and multiple inheritance. Learners gain hands-on experience with custom classes, special dunder methods, and memory optimization techniques like using slots. The course also covers data classes, type hinting, and class methods, offering a robust understanding of how to effectively apply OOP principles in Python projects.
 

# Project

In my recent project, I delved into developing and deploying a serverless application using AWS services, including Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. This experience enriched my understanding of cloud infrastructure and serverless architectures. I learned how to:

Configure AWS Lambda Functions: Set up Lambda functions with the correct handler configurations and environment variables, ensuring seamless execution of backend logic.

Set Up API Gateway Endpoints: Created RESTful APIs using API Gateway, enabling secure and efficient communication between the frontend and backend services.

Manage Data with DynamoDB: Designed and interacted with DynamoDB tables, implementing CRUD operations and managing data storage effectively.

Throughout the project, I honed my problem-solving skills by debugging complex issues, such as environment variable mismatches and function handler errors. I became proficient in using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) for infrastructure as code, which streamlined the deployment process and improved resource management.

This project significantly contributed to my professional growth by:

Enhancing Technical Expertise: Deepened my knowledge of AWS services and serverless computing, making me more adept at building scalable and cost-effective applications.

Improving Troubleshooting Abilities: Developed a methodical approach to diagnosing and fixing issues, which is crucial for maintaining robust applications.

Adopting Best Practices: Embraced best practices in software development, such as code modularity, proper error handling, and efficient resource utilization.

Overall, this experience has equipped me with practical skills in cloud computing and reinforced my capability to deliver high-quality solutions in a collaborative environment.
